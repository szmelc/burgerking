# Burger King app

### Create your own burger

https://burgerbuilder-c4742.firebaseapp.com/

### 

This app allows you to create your own, delicious, one and only burger. After you choose ingredients (you can choose bacon, meat, salad and cheese), you place an order and wait for your burger just to find out it's never gonna come. However, the request is sent to the Firebase database anyway!

Enjoy ordering fictional burgers!
